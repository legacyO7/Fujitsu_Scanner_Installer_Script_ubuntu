note for dev :
	Since I am terminated from KM Technologies, I wont be able to continue this project. So here I present 
the final build (FSI v2.4) which will be compactable with any software modifications done be Fujitsu and 
works for any Fujitsu high speed scanners. FSI v2.2 supports almost all Ubuntu installations but in future
when it fails, this build (FSI v2.4) will help you continue the installation process. 


Thanks for the support. This project is closed
